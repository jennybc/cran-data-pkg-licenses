averisk
Calculation of Average Population Attributable Fractions and Confidence Intervals
Average population attributable fractions are calculated for a set of risk factors (either binary or ordinal valued) for both prospective and case- control designs. Confidence intervals are found by Monte Carlo simulation. The method can be applied to either prospective or case control designs, provided an estimate of disease prevalence is provided. In addition to an exact calculation of AF, an approximate calculation, based on randomly sampling permutations has been implemented to ensure the calculation is computationally tractable when the number of risk factors is large.

lakemorpho
Lake Morphometry Metrics in R
Lake morphometry metrics are used by limnologists to understand, among other things, the ecological processes in a lake. Traditionally, these metrics are calculated by hand, with planimeters, and increasingly with commercial GIS products. All of these methods work; however, they are either outdated, difficult to reproduce, or require expensive licenses to use. The lakemorpho package provides the tools to calculate a typical suite of these metrics from an input elevation model and lake polygon. The metrics currently supported are: fetch, major axis, minor axis, maximum length, maximum width, mean width,maximum depth, mean depth, shoreline development, shoreline length, surface area, and volume.

paleotree
Paleontological and Phylogenetic Analyses of Evolution
Provides tools for transforming, a posteriori time-scaling, and modifying phylogenies containing extinct (i.e. fossil) lineages. In particular, most users are interested in the functions timePaleoPhy(), bin\_timePaleoPhy(), cal3TimePaleoPhy() and bin\_cal3TimePaleoPhy(), which a posteriori time-scale cladograms of fossil taxa into dated phylogenies. This package also contains a large number of likelihood functions for estimating sampling and diversification rates from different types of data available from the fossil record (e.g. range data, occurrence data, etc). paleotree users can also simulate diversification and sampling in the fossil record using the function simFossilRecord(), which is a detailed simulator for branching birth-death-sampling processes composed of discrete taxonomic units arranged in ancestor-descendant relationships. Users can use simFossilRecord() to simulate diversification in incompletely sampled fossil records, under various models of morphological differentiation (i.e. the various patterns by which morphotaxa originate from one another), and with time-dependent, longevity-dependent and/or diversity-dependent rates of diversification, extinction and sampling. Additional functions allow users to translate simulated ancestor-descendant data from simFossilRecord() into standard time-scaled phylogenies or unscaled cladograms that reflect the relationships among taxon units.

quickmapr
Quickly Map and Explore Spatial Data
While analyzing geospatial data, easy visualization is often needed that allows for quick plotting, and simple, but easy interactivity. Additionally, visualizing geospatial data in projected coordinates is also desirable. The 'quickmapr' package provides a simple method to visualize 'sp' and 'raster' objects, allows for basic zooming, panning, identifying, labeling, selecting, and measuring spatial objects. Importantly, it does not require that the data be in geographic coordinates.

Also included is the ability to include point independence (increasing correlation multiple observer's observations as a function of distance, with independence assumed for distance=0 or first distance bin), as well as the ability to model species misclassification rates using a multinomial logit formulation on data from double observers. New in version 2.1 is the ability to include zero inflation, but this is only recommended for cases where sample sizes and spatial coverage of the survey are high.

qfasar
Quantitative Fatty Acid Signature Analysis in R
An implementation of Quantitative Fatty Acid Signature Analysis (QFASA) in R. QFASA is a method of estimating the diet composition of predators. The fundamental unit of information in QFASA is a fatty acid signature (signature), which is a vector of proportions describing the composition of fatty acids within lipids. Signature data from at least one predator and from samples of all potential prey types are required. Calibration coefficients, which adjust for the differential metabolism of individual fatty acids by predators, are also required. Given those data inputs, a predator signature is modeled as a mixture of prey signatures and its diet estimate is obtained as the mixture that minimizes a measure of distance between the observed and modeled signatures. A variety of estimation options and simulation capabilities are implemented. Please refer to the vignette for additional details and references.

BaTFLED3D
Bayesian Tensor Factorization Linked to External Data
BaTFLED is a machine learning algorithm designed to make predictions and determine interactions in data that varies along three independent modes. For example BaTFLED was developed to predict the growth of cell lines when treated with drugs at different doses. The first mode corresponds to cell lines and incorporates predictors such as cell line genomics and growth conditions. The second mode corresponds to drugs and incorporates predictors indicating known targets and structural features. The third mode corresponds to dose and there are no dose-specific predictors (although the algorithm is capable of including predictors for the third mode if present). See 'BaTFLED3D\_vignette.rmd' for a simulated example.

modes
Find the Modes and Assess the Modality of Complex and Mixture Distributions, Especially with Big Datasets
Designed with a dual purpose of accurately estimating the mode (or modes) as well as characterizing the modality of data. The specific application area includes complex or mixture distributions particularly in a big data environment. The heterogeneous nature of (big) data may require deep introspective statistical and machine learning techniques, but these statistical tools often fail when applied without first understanding the data. In small datasets, this often isn't a big issue, but when dealing with large scale data analysis or big data thoroughly inspecting each dimension typically yields an O(n^n-1) problem. As such, dealing with big data require an alternative toolkit. This package not only identifies the mode or modes for various data types, it also provides a programmatic way of understanding the modality (i.e. unimodal, bimodal, etc.) of a dataset (whether it's big data or not).
